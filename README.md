# Enhancing Data Literacy in Blind and Visually Impaired Students Through AI-Assisted Data Storytelling

This repository contains supplementary materials accompanying the paper "Enhancing Data Literacy in Blind and Visually Impaired Students Through AI-Assisted Data Storytelling," submitted to AIED 2025. It provides all necessary resources to replicate the experiment described in the study.

## Repository Structure

- **UDL/**  
  Contains Universal Design for Learning (UDL) parameters provided as input to ChatGPT. All files are in English, except for the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) of Cecilia, the visually impaired student featured in the case study, which is provided in Italian.

- **Data Storytelling/**  
  Contains parameters specific to data storytelling methods provided as input to ChatGPT.

- **Results/**  
  Includes the outputs generated by ChatGPT versions 4 and 4.5 during the experiments.

## Replicating the Experiment

To replicate the experiment, follow these steps:

1. **Access ChatGPT Plus:**
   Ensure you have access to ChatGPT Plus, as file upload capabilities and GPT-4/GPT-4.5 functionalities are necessary.

2. **Upload Files:**
   Upload the following documents from this repository:
   - Data Literacy Program for Grade 1 (from the `UDL` folder)
   - IEP Cecilia (from the `UDL` folder)
   - Available Technologies (from the `UDL` folder)
   - CSV dataset (from the `Data Storytelling` folder)

3. **Prompt:**
   Use the following prompt to generate the adapted AI-assisted data storytelling lesson:
   
   ```
   Adapt the attached program titled "Data Literacy Program for Grade 1" to the profile of the Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) student attached titled "IEP Cecilia," using the assistive and didactic technologies specified in the attached file titled "Available Technologies." In adapting the program, generate a data-driven story that uses the data provided in CSV format, is based on entity comparison, and follows a 3-act structure.
   ```

## Requirements
- **ChatGPT Plus subscription**
- **GPT-4 and GPT-4.5 models**
